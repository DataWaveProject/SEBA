    A collection of tools to compute the Spectral Energy Budget of a dry and hydrostatic 
    Atmosphere. It is developed for applications to high-resolution simulations
    of General Circulation Models (GCMs). It implements the formulation developed
    by Augier and Lindborg (2013) and the Helmholtz decomposition into rotational
    and divergent kinetic energy contributions to the nonlinear kinetic energy fluxes
    introduced by Li et al. (2023).
